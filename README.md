# README AND TODOS

exploring basic audio functionality in browser, to expand my JS ability and do fun stuff. web audio api. thanks w3c. 

Two Mains Goals:
- build in browser sequencer blending samples and synthesis, with ability for user to add new samples, potentially record in browser and add to seqencer. 

- build WebAudio lesson for DBC

Achieved: 
- loading sounds to page via XML request
- sine wave oscilator on/off
- buttons that trigger samples
- basic sequencing in visual grid, currently at 8 steps

## TODOS

- better understand audio buffer loading, and maintaining samples in buffer without repeat xml round trips

- dynamically generate steps in sequencer - user input for how big a sequence you want

- implement Chris Wilson's Metronome, for rock solid timing and variable bpm while sequence is running

- looping!! derp... big missing link here. 

- tap tempo setting of metronome

- visuals. don't need to be a prom queen - but not a 1995 table site. should be cleaner - metronome should sync with visual light cue


## EVENTUALLY 

- effects and smart routing
- real MVC design with JS
